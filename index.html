            Core Scientific Metadata Model (CSMD) 
        </h1>

<p>
The Core Scientific Meta-Data Model (CSMD) is a study-data oriented
model which has been developed at STFC over many years. It captures
high level information about scientific studies and the data that they
produce.  The ICAT schema finds its origins in CSMD, though it has a
number of additional implementation specific features.
</p>

<p>The CSMD is developed to support data collected within a facility's
scientific workflow. However the model is also designed to be generic
across scientific disciplines and has application beyond facilities
science, particularly in the "structural sciences" (such as chemistry,
material science, earth science, and biochemistry) which are concerned
with analysing the structure of substances, and perform systematic
experimental analyses on samples of those materials.
</p>

<p>
The model is organised around a notion of Studies, a study being a
body of scientific work on a particular subject of
investigation. During a study, a scientist would perform a number of
investigations e.g. experiments, observations, measurements and
simulations. Results from these investigations usually run through
different stages: raw data, analysed or derived data and end results
suitable for publication. The model has a hierarchical model of the
structure of scientific research programmes, projects and studies, and
also a generic model of the organisation of data sets into collections
and files.</p>

        <h2>Documentation on the Core Scientific Metadata Model</h2>
<p>
The latest version of the CSMD is version 4.0 from March 2013.  The
main extension on earlier versions of the model is enhanced support
for linking analysed data and software into the investigation.
